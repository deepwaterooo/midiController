#+title: MIDI Command Controller Interface
#+author: Heyan Huang

* Update 2/12/2014, Thursday,  updates include
** updates
- Didn't start until this week was mainly before the foot court work
  had waited more than one week to get docs processed, and waiting for
  work Schedule before Scheduling with advisor, and advisor approved
  it. 
- Scheduled Wednesday 12:30-1:30pm to meet advisor weekly, and will
  update at least once a week to record progress.
- For coming week's meeting, advisor suggested to get more keys
  combines with songs in the normal 25 key set besides the finished
  one. 
- Today got the Rectangle/Triangle shapes work and ready.

* Update 12/11/2014, updates include
** updates
- Temporatorily mimic phonon seekslider, but have not connected the signals and slots fully functioning yet;
- This seekslider may still eventually came back to use Phonon library using Qt4.8 version;
- So far consider this as a bonus feature;

** review
- Because of lack Xbee modules (needs devices from intstructor), so far playing only .wav file is ok;
- It is basic, setting one buttone to work only, without any threads yet, but will expend it to be better during spring semester.
- Spring semester (1 credit) will pack all my instructor's Tower Play modules into a well-designed fully-functional softwares for user's convenience.

* Update 12/09/2014, updates include
- worked in it a little bit to set the connections between Midi controller and Qt Creator;
- tried to implement pthead for reading user input, but got slightly frustrated today, and applied easier methods instead;
- the project basically satisfied the instructor's requirements for connecting one key to work for playing his sequence, for example, Surfinusa.wav file;
- Will demo to his to see if he has better suggestions. 

* Update 11/23/2014, updates include
- Cleaned repository so that it looks clean and nice;
- Remove menubar as suggested by advisor;
- Removed topright four line texts cause it's not necessary;
- Shifted top line keys so that they look like original midi controller layout;
- Changed PlainTextEdit so that they satifies the requirements;
- Added left side 8 keys, just that three keys *Bend*, *-Oct*, *Oct+* are *NOT* like the original shapes yet, need work on them later on;
- Will link possible functionalities to make it a functional softwares first, and then updates minus issues.
- Current layout looks as below snapshotted:

* Review 11/21/2014, updates include
** Review Contents
- Created most basic interface for the client, and reviewed with course instructor.
- Demo the most basic interface to him, and get corresponding specific requirements as listed followed.
  
[[./pic/2014-11-20_21:52:19.png]]

** Detailed Requirements
- menubar is NOT necessary, and could be removed away;
- Interface topright four line texts are not necessary, could be removed away;
- Interface top line keys should shift to the right by half key width so that the interface looks similar to the original midi controller keyboard;
- PlainTextEdit should be changed to be array of 25/33 lines of (text label, file name editor, browse QPushButton keys) layout;
- Left handside 8 keys should be included in the midi interface even functionalities are not required at this moment;
- When finished the above basic ones, if I have extra time, could explore the left side 8 keys to test if it is possible to use them to set a bunch of sequence so that save time when needed compared with set sequence one by one from the basic 25 keys.
  
* Project Requirements
- Use QuNexus Midi controller as a command controller to manipulate play sequence for tower lights show;
- Besides the main functionalities, create a Qt Creator Interface to help facilate the tower light playing process for clients convenience. 
  
* main functionality
** Read data from MIDI
  - Use the MIDI Controller as a speical Controller that can be operated to play specific songs sequence, or do some specific work.
  - play specific sequence may be the work for keys 0-9, and 10-12, how about other 20 keys? Do they require specific work to be done?
** Write data back to MIDI
  - When a key was pushed, the specific Controller key's LED is supposed to be on to indicate the operation. 
  - Trick about the LED to be continuously on is that when a key is pressed, that is 1 byte that indicates the "Duration" of the key press, I may need to 
    - try to set this byte to be a large value, (1 byte, 2^8 = 256, it has limits!)
    - or continuously reset is to be that large value;
    - or continuously write this key to be pressed data back to MIDI with time intervals
      
* Programming Language
** Qt
  - the worries that I have by using Qt is that if Qt has the capability to handle the MIDI-Linux connection problems. 
  - And also Qt-to-Audio (linux) connection things as well. Should it be Qt, or as far as I can set it to work in Linux, just let it be that way then?
** c++
  - I believe C++ is the most widely used Language used by those midi sequencer softwares, so I have no better choice than c++ right now.
